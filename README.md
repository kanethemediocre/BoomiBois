# BoomiBoisLocal
Latest version for running a local node.js server.

You will need to install node.js, npm, express, and socket.io.  Node.js installs to your computer, and provides a command line interface where you install express, and then socket.io in the BoomiBois folder.

Commands:

npm init
npm install express@4
npm install socket.io


There's a line in index.js, a "server.listen...." with an ip address.  That needs to be set to the local network server ip.
Join the server by browsing to that ip address and port.

I'm certain I've missed something in these instructions, let me know what it was.
